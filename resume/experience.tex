        \item {
          Deployed and configured GitHub CodeQL, Snyk, and Lacework Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using GitHub Actions \& Jenkins. These tools supported the scanning of C++, C\#, Python, Java, and JavaScript repositories.
        }
        \item {
          Built Tines SOAR automation to enrich alerts from Lacework with contextual and additional information. Based on this information Slack messages are sent, Jira tickets are created, and customized alerts are generated.
        }
        \item {
          Architected and implemented Tines automation to generate targeted Jira issues for vulnerabilities identified by Lacework and Snyk, resulting in an 89\% reduction in container vulnerabilities through remediation efforts.
        }
        \item {
          Led project to deploy Lacework for public cloud providers. Integrated Lacework into logs for user behavioral analytics. Deployed Lacework agents with IaC to monitor all hosts \& containers for vulnerabilities, malware, and user behavioral\\ anomalies. Deployed Lacework agentless scanning to gain comprehensive visibility into vulnerabilities on workloads.
        }
        \item {
          Directed annual pentests utilizing an external pentesting firm. Provisioned testing environments, configured access, managed communication with SRE, and triaged/reproduced vulnerabilities. Created tickets to fix all findings from the report and worked with development teams to identify false positives.
        }
        \item {
          Modernized responsible disclosure program by working with internal stakeholders to build a standardized and scalable responsible disclosure program. This program is primarily targeted at the intake of customer reported security findings. Standardizing this process resulted in faster response times for customers, better lines of communication internally, and higher quality analysis of reported findings.
        }
        \item {
          Assumed the role of security engineering Team Lead, overseeing and mentoring two junior security engineers. Conducted training sessions, assigned daily tasks, and provided guidance to foster their professional growth within the security domain.
