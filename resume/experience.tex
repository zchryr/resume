      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {
          Deployed and configured CodeQL, Mend, and Lacework Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning using GitHub Actions and Jenkins. These tools support the scanning of C++, C\#, Python, Java, and JavaScript repositories.
        }
        \item {
          Managed the implementation of Lacework across public cloud providers, seamlessly integrating it with CSPM, CloudTrail, and Audit Logs. Utilized IaC to automate Lacework agent and agentless deployments, monitoring all hosts and containers for vulnerabilities, malware, and user behavioral anomalies.
        }
        \item {
          Built Tines SOAR automation to enrich alerts from Lacework with important information and context. This enriched data is then leveraged to initiate automated workflows, resulting in targeted Slack notifications and efficient Jira ticket creation.
        }
        \item {
          Designed and implemented vulnerability management automation using Tines to process findings from Lacework and Mend. This reduced the organization's overall vulnerability exposure by 89\%.
        }
        \item {
          Directed annual pentests utilizing external pentesting firms. Provisioned testing environments, configured access, managed communication, and triaged/reproduced vulnerabilities. Created tickets to remediate all legitimate findings and worked with development teams to identify false positives.
        }
        \item {
          Modernized responsible disclosure program by working with internal stakeholders to build a standardized and scalable process. This resulted in faster response times, better lines of communication internally, and higher quality analysis of reported findings.
        }
        \item {
          Acted as security engineering Team Lead, overseeing and mentoring two junior security engineers. Conducted training sessions, assigned daily tasks, and provided guidance to foster their professional growth within the security domain.
        }
        \item {
          Collaborated with DevOps to migrate containerized services to hardened golden images, using secure base images and incorporating security best practices. This allows developers to focus on building applications, while ensuring a secure foundation for their work.
        }
        \item {
          Wrote automation to scan new Docker images with Lacework in both Artifactory and Jenkins pipelines, shifting left Docker image scanning and allowing Jenkins pipelines to block new Docker images that violate policies.
        }
